# NFT Xhibit

A virtual space for exploring NFT collections.

## Description

This project implements a thin wrapper around existing protocols using ERC-998, allowing for essentially an NFT crypto-collectibles wallet.
This project was intended to give users of various NFT platforms/marketplaces a virtual world to store and view their collectibles in an
interesting virtual world.

This project uses the Vyper smart contract language to provide a thin wrapper around existing contracts and manage NFTs on-chain.
The UI utilizes the A-Frame 3D library for creating virtual experiences using standard HTML/JS.
Development required a heavy dosage of eth-brownie.

$ git clone https://github.com/skellet0r/NFTXhibit.git
